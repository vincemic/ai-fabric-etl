# Azure Fabric X12 EDI Pipeline - Managed Identity & RBAC Enhancements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive managed identity and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) improvements added to the Azure Fabric X12 EDI processing pipeline infrastructure.

## Key Improvements Added

### 1. **User-Assigned Managed Identity (UMI)**
- **Resource**: `userManagedIdentity`
- **Purpose**: Provides a centralized identity that can be shared across multiple Azure services
- **Benefits**: 
  - Consistent identity across services
  - Easier management and auditing
  - Supports cross-resource access patterns

### 2. **Enhanced Data Factory Identity Configuration**
- **System-Assigned Identity**: Automatically managed by Azure
- **User-Assigned Identity**: Added for cross-service scenarios
- **Configuration**: `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned` identity type

### 3. **Azure Function App**
- **New Service**: Added for lightweight X12 processing tasks
- **Identity**: Both system and user-assigned managed identities
- **Security**: HTTPS only, disabled FTP, managed identity authentication
- **Configuration**: Python 3.11 runtime with Application Insights integration

### 4. **Service Bus Integration**
- **New Service**: Added for reliable message processing
- **Security**: Disabled local authentication (forces managed identity)
- **Queue**: X12 processing notifications with dead letter handling
- **TLS**: Minimum TLS 1.2 enforced

## RBAC Assignments

### Storage Account Access
| Service | Role | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| Data Factory (System MI) | Storage Blob Data Contributor | Storage Account | Read/write X12 files |
| User Managed Identity | Storage Blob Data Contributor | Storage Account | Cross-service data access |
| Data Factory (System MI) | Reader | Storage Account | Monitoring and metadata |
| Function App (System MI) | Storage Blob Data Contributor | Storage Account | Process X12 files |
| Admin User | Storage Blob Data Owner | Storage Account | Administrative access |

### Key Vault Access
| Service | Role | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| Data Factory (System MI) | Key Vault Secrets User | Key Vault | Read connection strings |
| User Managed Identity | Key Vault Secrets User | Key Vault | Cross-service secrets access |
| Data Factory (System MI) | Key Vault Certificate User | Key Vault | SSL/TLS certificates |
| Function App (System MI) | Key Vault Secrets User | Key Vault | Application secrets |
| Admin User | Key Vault Administrator | Key Vault | Full administrative access |

### Service Bus Access
| Service | Role | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| Data Factory (System MI) | Azure Service Bus Data Sender | Service Bus | Send processing notifications |
| Function App (System MI) | Azure Service Bus Data Receiver | Service Bus | Receive and process messages |
| User Managed Identity | Azure Service Bus Data Owner | Service Bus | Comprehensive queue management |

### Monitoring & Management
| Service | Role | Scope | Purpose |
|---------|------|-------|---------|
| Data Factory (System MI) | Monitoring Contributor | Log Analytics | Write monitoring data |
| User Managed Identity | Contributor | Resource Group | Pipeline and resource management |

## Security Enhancements

### 1. **Authentication**
- **Managed Identity Only**: No access keys or connection strings in configuration
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each service has only required permissions
- **Cross-Service Security**: User-assigned identity for complex workflows

### 2. **Storage Security**
- **Disabled Key Access**: `allowSharedKeyAccess: false`
- **HTTPS Only**: `supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true`
- **Minimum TLS 1.2**: `minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'`
- **Private Blob Access**: All containers set to `publicAccess: 'None'`

### 3. **Key Vault Security**
- **RBAC Authorization**: `enableRbacAuthorization: true`
- **Soft Delete**: `enableSoftDelete: true` with 30-day retention
- **Purge Protection**: `enablePurgeProtection: true`
- **Network ACLs**: Configured for Azure services bypass

### 4. **Service Bus Security**
- **Disabled Local Auth**: `disableLocalAuth: true`
- **Minimum TLS 1.2**: `minimumTlsVersion: '1.2'`
- **Managed Identity Only**: Forces Azure AD authentication

## Monitoring & Diagnostics

### 1. **Diagnostic Settings Added**
- **Storage Account**: Transaction and capacity metrics → Log Analytics
- **Data Factory**: Pipeline, trigger, and activity logs → Log Analytics
- **Key Vault**: Audit events and policy evaluations → Log Analytics (90-day retention)

### 2. **Application Insights**
- **Connection String**: Configured for Function App monitoring
- **Workspace Integration**: Connected to Log Analytics workspace

## Parameters & Configuration

### New Parameters
```bicep
@description('Object ID of the admin user/group for Key Vault access')
param adminPrincipalId string = ''

@description('Enable private endpoints for enhanced security (future enhancement)')
param enablePrivateEndpoints bool = false
```

### Enhanced Outputs
- Managed identity principal IDs and client IDs
- Service names and connection information
- Security-related resource identifiers

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Identity Management**
- ✅ Use managed identities instead of service principals where possible
- ✅ Implement both system and user-assigned identities appropriately
- ✅ Disable local authentication where supported

### 2. **RBAC Design**
- ✅ Use built-in roles instead of custom roles
- ✅ Apply principle of least privilege
- ✅ Scope permissions to appropriate resource levels
- ✅ Use deterministic GUID generation for role assignments

### 3. **Security Configuration**
- ✅ Disable public access where not needed
- ✅ Enable diagnostic logging for security events
- ✅ Implement network security controls
- ✅ Use HTTPS and TLS 1.2 minimum

### 4. **Monitoring & Compliance**
- ✅ Enable audit logging for Key Vault
- ✅ Monitor storage and data factory operations
- ✅ Implement retention policies for logs and metrics
- ✅ Enable change feed and versioning for storage

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

### 1. **Private Endpoints**
- Private endpoints for Storage Account
- Private endpoints for Key Vault
- Private endpoints for Service Bus
- VNet integration for Function App

### 2. **Advanced Security**
- Customer-managed encryption keys
- Network ACLs with IP restrictions
- Azure Private DNS zones
- Conditional access policies

### 3. **Additional Services**
- Azure SQL Database with managed identity
- Azure Cosmos DB for metadata storage
- Azure Event Hub for high-throughput scenarios
- Azure API Management for external APIs

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Resource group created or sufficient permissions to create
- Admin user principal ID (optional but recommended)

### 2. **Deployment Order**
- User-assigned managed identity (first)
- Core services (Storage, Key Vault, Log Analytics)
- Compute services (Data Factory, Function App, Service Bus)
- RBAC assignments (last)

### 3. **Post-Deployment Tasks**
- Verify managed identity assignments
- Test service-to-service authentication
- Configure application-specific settings
- Validate diagnostic logging

This enhanced infrastructure provides a secure, scalable, and maintainable foundation for X12 EDI processing with comprehensive managed identity and RBAC controls.
